# Slideshow Utility

The Slideshow utility extends the `react-responsive-carousel` plugin. Use this
utility to create a clickable/swipeable slideshow.

This utility exports one component, `Slideshow`, which is a wrapper for a group
of slides.

## Plugin API

For plugin options, see the `react-responsive-carousel`
[documentation](https://github.com/leandrowd/react-responsive-carousel). Any of
the settings attributes can be passed as props.

In this utility, the plugin component `Carousel` has been renamed `Slideshow` to
apply default styles and settings. They are otherwise identical and can accept
the same props.

The `Slideshow` component assigns a few default settings, but these can be
overridden by passing new props:

```jsx
showStatus: false
showIndicators: false
showThumbs: false
infiniteLoop: true
useKeyboardArrows: true
```

## Usage

Import the Slideshow utility and use it as a wrapper for slides:

```jsx
import Slideshow from "./utilities/slideshow"

<Slideshow>{/* children */}</Slideshow>
```

Every direct child of `Slideshow` will become a slide. Images should be wrapped
in a `<div>`. This will set the images to fill the entire width and height of
the slide, even if the images are different sizes or aspect ratios:

```jsx
<Slideshow>
  <div><img /></div>
  <div><img /></div>
</Slideshow>
```

## Slide Size

The slide container will match the aspect ratio of the tallest image in the
slideshow, up to 286px. Images will fill the width of the slide and the slides
will fill the width of the containing component.

Images are set to `object-fit: cover`. All gatsby-images should use theIE11
polyfill:

```jsx
import Img from "gatsby-image/withIEPolyfill"

// ...
<Img
  fluid={image.fluid}
  objectFit="cover"
  objectPosition="50% 50%"
/>
```

## Styling

The Slideshow utility styles can be edited in the
`./utilities/slideshow/slideshow.scss` file. This file is based on the default
package CSS, modified to match the Kitchen 1883 brand.
