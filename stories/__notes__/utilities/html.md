# HTML Utility

The HTML utility accepts two properties. The first is a required property `field`. The field
property must be an object with a `childMarkdownRemark` key, which subsequently has a
single key, `html`, which ultimately holds the HTML string that is to be
rendered within a `<div>` element.

This component is structured in this way because this is the strcture expected
by [the gatsby-transformer-remark
plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-transformer-remark/). And,
generally, we only need to use this component in conjunction with data coming
from the CMS database. Thus, it was likely transformed from markdown into an
HTML string.

The HTML utility also accepts an optional string property `className`. It allows the
component to be styled, either with CSS classes or by extending it with Styled
Components: `styled(HTML)`.

## Usage

Consider we have a markdown field for a Page model in the CMS called `body` with
content like so:

```md
# Hello World

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
```

When the page's contents are retrieved, supposing they are saved to a `page`
variable, the body field's structure would look like this:

```js
const body = page.body.childMarkdownRemark.html
// => <h1>Hello World</h1><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
```

Then we can send that object directly to the HTML utility to have it rendered on the page.

```jsx
<HTML field={body} />
```

Which would translate to something like this:

```html
<div>
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>
</div>
```
